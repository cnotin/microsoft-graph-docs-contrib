## Request body
In the request body, supply *only* the values for properties that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. 

The following table specifies the properties that can be updated. 

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|

| backgroundImage | Stream | Image that appears as the background of the sign-in page. The allowed types are PNG or JPEG not smaller than 300 KB and not larger than 1920 × 1080 pixels. A smaller image will reduce bandwidth requirements and make the page load faster. |

| squareLogo | Stream | A square version of your company logo that appears in Windows 10 out-of-box experiences (OOBE) and when Windows Autopilot is enabled for deployment. Allowed types are PNG or JPEG no larger than 240 x 240 pixels and no more than 10 KB in size. We recommend using a transparent image with no padding around the logo. |
